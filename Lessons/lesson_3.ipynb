    "#### Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions about unseen or future data. In supervised learning, a dataset is provided with input data (features) and corresponding output labels (targets) that are already known, and the algorithm learns to map the input data to the output labels. The goal is to learn a function that can accurately predict the output for new input data."

    "#### Labeled data is a set of input data that has been pre-tagged with the correct output. This means that the data has been categorized, classified or annotated by humans or experts in the field with the expected outcome. The labeled data is used to train the model to recognize patterns, features and characteristics in new, unseen data. For instance, in an image classification task, the input data would be a collection of images and the corresponding labels would be the object or objects present in the image, such as \"dog,\" \"cat,\" \"car,\" or \"tree.\" The labeled data is used to train the model to identify the objects present in an image, so that when it encounters new, unseen images, it can accurately classify them. The quality and quantity of labeled data is essential for the success of a supervised learning model."

    "#### In the previous lesson, we have covered the importance of data preparation and preprocessing for machine learning, particularly in supervised learning. We have discussed how poorly prepared data can lead to inaccurate models, biased predictions, and overall poor performance. This chapter will further emphasize the significance of proper data preparation by diving into specific techniques that can be applied to datasets before training a supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling missing data is one of the most critical aspects of data preparation. Missing values can lead to incomplete records and biased models if not dealt with properly. We have previously talked about different methods for handling missing data, such as imputation or deletion, depending on the nature and extent of the missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another essential aspect of data preparation is feature scaling and normalization. This technique involves transforming numerical features into a standard range to prevent certain features from dominating others. By scaling the features, we can ensure that the machine learning algorithm assigns equal importance to all features and produces accurate results. We have previously discussed different scaling and normalization techniques, such as MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lastly, this chapter will introduce one-hot encoding and categorical variables. Categorical data, such as colors or product types, can be challenging to include in machine learning models, as they are not numerical. One-hot encoding is a process of converting categorical data into numerical data, which can be fed into machine learning algorithms. We will discuss different techniques for one-hot encoding, and how to apply them to categorical variables in a dataset."
