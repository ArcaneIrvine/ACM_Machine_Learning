    "#### In the previous lesson, we have covered the importance of data preparation and preprocessing for machine learning, particularly in supervised learning. We have discussed how poorly prepared data can lead to inaccurate models, biased predictions, and overall poor performance. This chapter will further emphasize the significance of proper data preparation by diving into specific techniques that can be applied to datasets before training a supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling missing data is one of the most critical aspects of data preparation. Missing values can lead to incomplete records and biased models if not dealt with properly. We have previously talked about different methods for handling missing data, such as imputation or deletion, depending on the nature and extent of the missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another essential aspect of data preparation is feature scaling and normalization. This technique involves transforming numerical features into a standard range to prevent certain features from dominating others. By scaling the features, we can ensure that the machine learning algorithm assigns equal importance to all features and produces accurate results. We have previously discussed different scaling and normalization techniques, such as MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lastly, this chapter will introduce one-hot encoding and categorical variables. Categorical data, such as colors or product types, can be challenging to include in machine learning models, as they are not numerical. One-hot encoding is a process of converting categorical data into numerical data, which can be fed into machine learning algorithms. We will discuss different techniques for one-hot encoding, and how to apply them to categorical variables in a dataset."
